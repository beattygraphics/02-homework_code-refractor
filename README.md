## Takeaways

I had to sit with this project for a few days, and look at the CSS many times in compairison to the markup file.  This being the first project after only 1 week of actually looking at any type of css or index files.  I see why the class starts with this type of homework. I feel like having to fix something that already exists let me sit with some of the syntax and get used to it.  This was a great learning tool for me,
